		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<p>
			I like to play football at the weekend with my friends. We have a small club and we get together and play a game of football. Nothing serious just for fun, really. 
			But we like it because it is good fun and we can all have a laugh together plus it is good exercise and gets us out of the house.

		<h2> Passions </h2>
		<p>
			I like to paint in my free time. I can’t paint in the house because my parents say it is too messy, all the paint and oil, so I use the shed in our garden. I can sit in there and no one disturbs me. I usually paint at the weekend if not palying football, or after school, I like to paint whenever I have some spare time.

		<h2>Project </h2>
		<p>
			My goal is to find a company where I can grow my career and develop new professional skills. In five years, I imagine I’d like to be in a leadership position — additionally, I’m interested in learning more about the content strategy side of the business. However, I find it most important to find a company that encourages continuous learning, as yours does.
